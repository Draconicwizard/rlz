#summary This page contains detailed information on building RLZ on Windows

= Build environment =

RLZ uses the same build environment as Chromium.  Follow the instructions in the section [http://www.chromium.org/developers/how-tos/build-instructions-windows#TOC-Build-environment Build Environment], up to and including the step "Get the Chromium depot_tools".

Do not checkout the Chromium code.

= Checking out the RLZ code =

Open a Command Prompt window and execute the following commands:

{{{
C:
mkdir \src\RLZ
cd \src\RLZ
gclient config http://rlz.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ --name src/rlz
gclient sync
}}}

The last command may take a few minutes to complete, depending on the speed of your Internet connection.

At any time re-run the {{{gclient sync}}} command to checkout the latest revision of the RLZ code.

== Using Visual Studio 2010 ==

When using Visual Studio 2010, define the environment variable {{{GYP_MSVS_VERSION}}} before running gclient sync:

{{{
set GYP_MSVS_VERSION=2010
gclient sync
}}}

= Building the RLZ code =

{{{gclient sync}}} creates a Visual Studio solution file called {{{C:\src\RLZ\src\rlz\rlz.sln}}} for the entire RLZ project.  To build, either open this solution in the Visual Studio IDE or run the following command in a Command Prompt window:

{{{devenv /build Debug rlz.sln /project rlz_unittests.vcproj}}}

Run {{{C:\src\RLZ\src\rlz\Debug\rlz_unittests.exe}}} and make sure all tests pass.
